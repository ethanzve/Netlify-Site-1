Taking to Twitter, the US Defence Secretary wrote, &#8220;I&#8217;m returning to India to meet with key leaders for discussions about strengthening our Major Defense Partnership.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Together, we&#8217;re advancing a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Austin&#8217;s New Delhi visit will prominently focus on advancing India-US new defence innovation and industrial cooperation initiatives and continuing with the efforts to expand operational cooperation between the US and Indian militaries.<\/p>\n<p>The Pentagon, while elaborating on the details of the Defence Secretary&#8217;s visit, said, &#8220;After Singapore, Secretary Austin will visit New Delhi to meet with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and other leaders as the United States and India continue to modernize the US-India Major Defence Partnership.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This visit provides an opportunity to accelerate new defence innovation and industrial cooperation initiatives and drive ongoing efforts to expand operational cooperation between the US and Indian militaries,&#8221; the statement added.<\/p>\n<p>During his New Delhi visit, Austin is set to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh with an aim to expand the defence-industrial partnership.<\/p>\n<p>The visit holds particular significance considering Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s upcoming state visit to the White House in June.<\/p>\n<p>Austin attended the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and his first stop was in Tokyo where he met with Japanese defence minister Yasukasu Hamada and other senior leaders and visited US troops stationed in Japan.<\/p>\n<p>Later, from Japan, he flew to Singapore, where he addressed plenary remarks at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) 20th Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.<\/p>\n<p>During his stay in Singapore, he also held key bilateral meetings to advance US partnerships across the region.<\/p>\n<p>After New Delhi, the US Defence Secretary will embark on a visit to France.<\/p>\n<p>Also just before PM Modi&#8217;s visit to the US, a powerful Congressional Committee has recommended strengthening NATO Plus by including India. This step is a move to deter China.<\/p>\n<p>The suggestion of including India in the five-member grouping has been made by the committee to win the &#8220;strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Presently, NATO Plus 5 is a security arrangement that works towards boosting global defence cooperation and comprises NATO and five aligned countries, Australia, Japan, Israel, New Zealand and South Korea.<\/p>\n<p>India getting included in NATO Plus would mean the facilitation of seamless intelligence sharing between these nations and India and access to the latest military technology with a minimal time lag, reported NewsonAir.<\/p>\n<p>Secretary Austin will conclude his four-nation trip in France and will take part in events commemorating the 79th anniversary of D-Day and meet with French and United Kingdom defence leaders.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin arrived in India from Singapore on Sunday to further strengthen the defence partnership between the two nations.
