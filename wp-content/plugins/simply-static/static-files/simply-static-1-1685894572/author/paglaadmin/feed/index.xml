										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie&#8217;s legal fight seems to be never-ending.</p>
<p>As per media, Pitt is now suing Jolie for selling her portion of their shared French vineyard without consulting him.</p>
<p>The Oscar-winning actor claimed in new court documents that amid the continued war in Ukraine &#8212; the association presents an “existential threat to the business” due to the new part owner’s tie to Russia.</p>
<p>The first amended complaint about the winery, filed in February 2022, sought damages for declaratory relief, disgorgement, and damages, along with pre and post-judgment interest for the defendants&#8217; alleged tortious interference with contractual relations.</p>
<p>In legal documents obtained by a media outlet, the complaint alleged that Jolie sold her interests in the property to Tenute del Mondo, whose parent company is the spirits manufacturer Stoli Group, which is &#8220;controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shefler&#8217;s Russia-affiliated spirits conglomerate has been the subject of repeated boycotts in connection with Vladimir Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and homophobic legislative Agenda,&#8221; the lawsuit stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Shefler may be seeking to launder his reputation by forcing a partnership with one of the world&#8217;s most well-known and popular actors, affiliation with Shefler and Stoli jeopardises the reputation of the business that Pitt so carefully built with Perrin and with which Pitt has so closely and carefully associated himself and his image.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pitt reportedly learned of Jolie&#8217;s alleged putative sale via a press release.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims the purported sale was &#8220;unlawful&#8221; due to &#8220;contractual agreement&#8221; breaches between Jolie and Pitt &#8220;to hold Miraval together and not sell their interests separately without the other&#8217;s consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pitt and Jolie gained a controlling interest in Miraval in 2008. They began selling their own rose in March 2013 and got married at the chateau in August 2014.</p>
<p>Pitt alleges that when Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, they both agreed not to sell their Miraval shares without each other&#8217;s permission. , US Magazine reported.</p>
<p>However, in 2021, the Girl Interrupted star sold her portion of the business to Tenute del Mondo.</p>
<p>In September 2016, the Gia actress filed for divorce from Pitt after two years of marriage and 12 years together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manchester City are one game away from a historic treble after Ilkay Gundogan scored twice to beat Manchester United 2-1 in the FA Cup final on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola&#8217;s men completed a domestic double at Wembley and can become just the second side, after United in 1998/99, to win the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League in the same season should they beat Inter Milan to become European champions for the first time on June 10.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in a position we will probably never be in again,&#8221; said Guardiola.</p>
<p>&#8220;To win the FA Cup, the emotions are so special and to celebrate it with our people is really great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gundogan scored the fastest goal in FA Cup final history after just 12 seconds.</p>
<p>United levelled on 33 minutes through Bruno Fernandes&#8217; penalty after Jack Grealish was harshly penalised for handball.</p>
<p>But the City captain, in what could be his final game for the club on English soil with his contract expiring at the end of the season, volleyed home the winner six minutes into the second-half.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone knows the FA Cup is the most beautiful domestic club competition in the world, so to win this trophy again and complete the double is amazing for us,&#8221; said Gundogan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a chance to do something special and win the treble and we do not want to let this opportunity pass us by.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first major final between the Manchester giants had the most explosive of starts.</p>
<p>Most of the 83,000 crowd were still taking their seats from the pre-match festivities when Victor Lindelof&#8217;s headed clearance sat up perfectly for Gundogan to volley home a stunning strike.</p>
<p>That appeared to set the tone for the Premier League champions as United were barely able to get across the halfway line in the first half hour.</p>
<p>But Erik ten Hag&#8217;s men got the slice of luck they needed to get back into the game.</p>
<p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka&#8217;s header back across the City box brushed the arm of Grealish and referee Paul Tierney awarded a penalty after a VAR review.</p>
<p>Fernandes coolly sent Stefan Ortega the wrong way, but the Portuguese&#8217;s celebrations in front of the City fans were met with a flurry of objects thrown from the stands, one of which struck Lindelof.</p>
<p>De Gea question mark<br />
Having fought so hard to gain a foothold, United were made to pay for another slow start in the second-half.</p>
<p>Gundogan was the goalscorer again as he fired home from De Bruyne&#8217;s free-kick.</p>
<p>But more questions will be asked of whether David De Gea remains the right man to be United&#8217;s number one goalkeeper after the 32-year-old Spaniard&#8217;s sluggish attempt to keep it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were tough goals, they were so soft and avoidable,&#8221; said Ten Hag.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you play against City and you don&#8217;t concede almost nothing from open play, it is a big credit for the team, but if you concede goals like this it is disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Gea did at least make big saves to keep United in the game from De Bruyne and Haaland, while Gundogan was denied a rare FA Cup final hat-trick by the offside flag.</p>
<p>United rallied in a tense finale as Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho flashed efforts inches off target.</p>
<p>The ball came back off the City bar in a goalmouth scramble deep into stoppage time.</p>
<p>However, the Red Devils could not find the goal to deny Guardiola an 11th major trophy as City boss and protect the unique legacy of Alex Ferguson&#8217;s great side 24 years ago.</p>
<p>Only Inter in Istanbul in a week&#8217;s time now stand between City and matching the greatest achievement English club football has ever seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin arrived in India from Singapore on Sunday to further strengthen the defence partnership between the two nations.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival, US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, received the Pentagon Chief who kickstarted the third leg of his four-nation tour. Taking to Twitter, the US Defence Secretary wrote, &#8220;I&#8217;m returning to India to meet with key leaders for discussions about strengthening our Major Defense Partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, we&#8217;re advancing a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Austin&#8217;s New Delhi visit will prominently focus on advancing India-US new defence innovation and industrial cooperation initiatives and continuing with the efforts to expand operational cooperation between the US and Indian militaries.</p>
<p>The Pentagon, while elaborating on the details of the Defence Secretary&#8217;s visit, said, &#8220;After Singapore, Secretary Austin will visit New Delhi to meet with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and other leaders as the United States and India continue to modernize the US-India Major Defence Partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This visit provides an opportunity to accelerate new defence innovation and industrial cooperation initiatives and drive ongoing efforts to expand operational cooperation between the US and Indian militaries,&#8221; the statement added.</p>
<p>During his New Delhi visit, Austin is set to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh with an aim to expand the defence-industrial partnership.</p>
<p>The visit holds particular significance considering Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s upcoming state visit to the White House in June.</p>
<p>Austin attended the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and his first stop was in Tokyo where he met with Japanese defence minister Yasukasu Hamada and other senior leaders and visited US troops stationed in Japan.</p>
<p>Later, from Japan, he flew to Singapore, where he addressed plenary remarks at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) 20th Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.</p>
<p>During his stay in Singapore, he also held key bilateral meetings to advance US partnerships across the region.</p>
<p>After New Delhi, the US Defence Secretary will embark on a visit to France.</p>
<p>Also just before PM Modi&#8217;s visit to the US, a powerful Congressional Committee has recommended strengthening NATO Plus by including India. This step is a move to deter China.</p>
<p>The suggestion of including India in the five-member grouping has been made by the committee to win the &#8220;strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party&#8221;.</p>
<p>Presently, NATO Plus 5 is a security arrangement that works towards boosting global defence cooperation and comprises NATO and five aligned countries, Australia, Japan, Israel, New Zealand and South Korea.</p>
<p>India getting included in NATO Plus would mean the facilitation of seamless intelligence sharing between these nations and India and access to the latest military technology with a minimal time lag, reported NewsonAir.</p>
<p>Secretary Austin will conclude his four-nation trip in France and will take part in events commemorating the 79th anniversary of D-Day and meet with French and United Kingdom defence leaders.</p>
